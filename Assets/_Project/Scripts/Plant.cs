     * point is at the pullAngle and then hide it
     * we only reveal and part of it near player indicator
     * 
     * only issue is if we want to reuse this for say roots.... then we would have a variable number of 
     * bulges inidcating areas of interest... 
     * 
     * first things first get a circle + mouse indicator
